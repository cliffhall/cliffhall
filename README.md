## üß† Focused on AI
- ‚ú® At [Culturalyst](https://culturalyst.com), I recently used AI to overcome a showstopping issue with gathering artist opportunities from around the web and directing them to subscribing artists. With AI, I was able to classify opportunities from random sites into our taxonomy, normalizing the data fields such that they appeared to have been entered through our own UI.

- ‚ú® With [PlotRocket](https://plotrocket.app), an AI-assisted writers' room, I am combining artificial intelligence with common industry practices for creating episodic fiction, yielding a tool capable of planning multiple seasons of a television series down to the scene and beat. With or without the use of AI. It allows anyone to turn an idea into an engaging episodic story.

### ‚õì An on-chain builder through multiple bulls and bears
In 2018 I began working with Solidity, convinced that NFTs (not crypto) might actually be useful. I documented my developer journey as I discovered how radically different the field was from any other language or environment 
I had ever worked on. It was bewildering, interesting, and greenfields as far as the eye could see. Everything hadn't been built, and the possibilities were endless. 

Since then, crypto scams and the vicissitudes of the market have made it impossible to work in as a professional developer for hire, so I have decided to redirect all of my focus to AI, but I learned a lot on my blockchain journey, and met a lot of great people along the way.
