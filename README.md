## ðŸ§  Refocusing on AI
- âœ¨ At [Culturalyst](https://culturalyst.com), I used AI to map and categorize diverse artist opportunities from around the web. 
- âœ¨ With [PlotRocket](https://plotrocket.app), an AI-assisted writers' room, I combined artificial intelligence with a common industry practice for creating episodic fiction, yielding a tool capable of planning multiple seasons of a television series down to the scene and beat. It allows anyone to turn an idea into an engaging episodic story.
