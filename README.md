### 🧠 Focusing on AI
I spent much of 2023 building [PlotRocket](https://plotrocket.app), an AI-assisted writers' room. It combines artificial intelligence with a standard industry practice for creating episodic fiction, to yield a tool capable of planning multiple seasons of a television series down to the scene and beat. It allows anyone to turn an idea into an engaging episodic story. Not a tool for push-button AI shovelware, but a force multiplier for creative talent. I continue to build and improve it, while considering what to actually do with it.
